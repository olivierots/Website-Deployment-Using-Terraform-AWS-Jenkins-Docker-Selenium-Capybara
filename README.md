## Project description ##
```
explore california is a travel company website has over 100,000 visit per month 
(http://explorecalifornia.org/) and want to ship new features faster, safely and
more reliably ? how can DevOps fix this ?
Production deploys 100% automated through CI & CD pipelines
The CI pipeline into production builds a website on the fly & run unit tests 
before every pull request enters review.
The CD pipeline deploys the website artifacts into AWS using terraform
a separate pipeline runs daily to merge the master branches from each dev team
into an integration environment than runs integratiosn tests and report failures
to each dev teams




```


## Learning objectives ##
```
Writing a Dockerfile
Using Docker Compose
Testing my app with RSpec, Capybara, and Selenium
Writing Terraform code
Deploying the website into AWS S3
Writing and running integration tests
Writing a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins that will build, test, and deploy the app.
apply DevOps principles to a sample app for a travel booking company
```

## Technical  ##
```
* containerized the website using Docker & Docker compose
* Used selenium, capybara & RSpec to write some units and integrations tests
* used terrafrom to deploy the working instance into the cloud
* wrote a CI/CD with jenkins to build, test & deploy the website
